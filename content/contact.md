### About
You are welcome to use, copy, modify, and distribute any of the content on this site. Credit is appreciated but is not necessary. 

This site is meant to serve as a place for resources and news pertaining to Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Forest Preserve. I created it to aid community members and facilitate their research for comments on the proposal. The information on this site was initially guided by journalist Ginger Strand’s presentation during a Town of Olive Board meeting. 

The content on this site is congregated (and clearly attributed) or written by Brookelyn Parslow. Her family resides on Moonhaw Road, which is one of the three areas that would be immediately affected by the proposal.
